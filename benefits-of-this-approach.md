# Benefits of this Approach

Smart contracts are highly deterministic, tamper-proof, and reliable digital agreements that operate on decentralized blockchains. Initially, NFTs were developed on the ERC protocol, and as a result, most mainstream NFT platforms now offer support for smart contracts. Uptick chain also extends its support to smart contracts as part of its core processes, encompassing both EVM and Wasm smart contracts. Additionally, Uptick chain plans to further broaden its support for various types of smart contracts in response to the specific business requirements of applications.

Furthermore, it's worth noting that traditional NFT platforms typically limit their support to NFT assets running on either EVM or WASM. Each of these NFT asset types comes with its distinct application scenarios and business requirements, necessitating seamless conversion between them.

To address this, Uptick facilitates support for mainstream EVM and WASM contracts and offers a streamlined conversion mechanism for these two types of assets at the contract layer.

## Leverage Advantages of Various Contracts

EVM-based contracts boast a larger developer community, and it's worth noting that the majority of NFT assets (over 90%) are built upon the ERC protocol. The EVM has undergone extensive scrutiny and has been validated for its security by numerous applications. Consequently, EVM-based smart contracts are the preferred choice for high-security, financial-grade NFT transactions.

Conversely, WASM-based contracts offer distinctive features, including high execution efficiency, memory safety, and platform independence. These attributes make them particularly well-suited for emerging application scenarios, such as functional and social NFT applications introduced in later stages.

## Mutual Conversion Based on Business Requirements and Scenarios

Uptick streamlines the conversion of contracts at the foundational level by executing contract transformations at the chain level. To illustrate, should there be a need to transition EVM contracts or a portion of the associated NFT assets into assets compatible with WASM contracts, Uptick's underlying contract converter seamlessly facilitates this conversion of NFT assets.

It's important to emphasize that the foundational technology of blockchain contracts is subject to ongoing updates and advancements. As a result, we remain committed to consistently enhancing Uptick's contract engine to ensure its compatibility with the most current contract development languages.
